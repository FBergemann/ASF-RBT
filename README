# Modeling Red-Black Trees this way now.
# Started by taking a red-black tree implementation from here: 
# http://en.literateprograms.org/Red-black_tree_%28C%29
# (rbtree.h, rbtree.c, rbtree_test.c - the latter slightly modified)
# First transmogrified that into C++.
# Then making obsolete the need for a *parent ptr 
# - left to do is remodeling of the delete(...) operation.
# (asf_rbtree.h asf_rbtree_test.cc)
