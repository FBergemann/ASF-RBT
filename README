# Trying now to model something for Red-Black Trees here.
# Started by taking a red-black tree implementation from here: 
# http://en.literateprograms.org/Red-black_tree_%28C%29
# Transmogrified that into C++.
# Now trying to make obsolete the need for a *parent ptr
# by what was discussed in comp.lang.c++.moderated.
